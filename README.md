Project: Data dig

We’ve curated a set of interesting data sets for you: NASA astronauts, Superbowl results, Pokemon stats, NBA players, Top movies, Top countries by population, Solar system objects by size, Marvel characters, Furniture store sales, Earned KA badges, Winston's donut logs, Card game results, and NFL draft picks.

Pick one of those data sets or create a data set like that, and use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. What sort of questions might one have about that data, like if they were using it for an app or a business idea? Here are some ideas:

What are average, max, and min values in the data?
What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
What ways are there to group the data values that don’t exist yet (using CASE)?
What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?

The population coding at the start is not my own.

In the subsequent code I used MAX, MIN and AVG to interrogate the data. I used CASE to allow me to compare the median age of countries to the world median and apply lables to those that were above or below the median. I used a GROUP BY and HAVING clause to arrange the countries by percentage change per year only for those that see an increase of above 1.
